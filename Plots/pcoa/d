_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

filename: the name of the output file.  The page number is substituted
          if a C integer format is included in the character string, as
          in the default.  (The result must be less than ‘PATH_MAX’
          characters long, and may be truncated if not.  See
          ‘postscript’ for further details.)  Tilde expansion is
          performed where supported by the platform.

   width: the width of the device in inches.

  height: the height of the device in inches.

pointsize: the default pointsize of plotted text (in big points).

 onefile: should all plots appear in one file or in separate files?

  family: one of the device-independent font families, ‘"sans"’,
          ‘"serif"’ and ‘"mono"’, or a character string specify a font
          family to be searched for in a system-dependent way.

          On unix-alikes (incl.\ Mac), see the ‘Cairo fonts’ section in
          the help for ‘X11’.

      bg: the initial background colour: can be overridden by setting
          par("bg").

antialias: string, the type of anti-aliasing (if any) to be used;
          defaults to ‘"default"’.

fallback_resolution: numeric: the resolution in dpi used when falling
          back to bitmap output.  Prior to R 3.3.0 this depended on the
          cairo implementation but was commonly 300.

symbolfamily: a length-one character string that specifies the font
          family to be used as the "symbol" font (e.g., for plotmath
          output).

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics) is a W3C standard for vector
     graphics.  See <https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/>.  The output
     from ‘svg’ is SVG version 1.1 for ‘onefile = FALSE’ (the default),
     otherwise SVG 1.2.  (Few SVG viewers are capable of displaying
     multi-page SVG files.)

     Note that unlike ‘postscript’ and ‘pdf’, ‘cairo_pdf’ and
     ‘cairo_ps’ sometimes record _bitmaps_ and not vector graphics.  On
     the other hand, they can (on suitable platforms) include a much
     wider range of UTF-8 glyphs, and embed the fonts used.

     The output produced by ‘cairo_ps(onefile = FALSE)’ will be
     encapsulated postscript on a platform with cairo >= 1.6.

     R can be compiled without support for any of these devices: this
     will be reported if you attempt to use them on a system where they
     are not supported.  They all require cairo version 1.2 or later.

     If you plot more than one page on one of these devices and do not
     include something like ‘%d’ for the sequence number in ‘file’ (or
     set ‘onefile = TRUE’) the file will contain the last page plotted.

     There is full support of semi-transparency, but using this is one
     of the things liable to trigger bitmap output (and will always do
     so for ‘cairo_ps’).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A plot device is opened: nothing is returned to the R interpreter.

_A_n_t_i-_a_l_i_a_s_i_n_g:

     Anti-aliasing is applied to both graphics and fonts.  It is
     generally preferable for lines and text, but can lead to
     undesirable effects for fills, e.g. for ‘image’ plots, and so is
     never used for fills.

     ‘antialias = "default"’ is in principle platform-dependent, but
     seems most often equivalent to ‘antialias = "gray"’.

_C_o_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n_s:

     This section describes the implementation of the conventions for
     graphics devices set out in the ‘R Internals’ manual.

        • The default device size is in pixels (‘svg’) or inches.

        • Font sizes are in big points.

        • The default font family is Helvetica.

        • Line widths are multiples of 1/96 inch.

        • Circle radii have a minimum of 1/72 inch.

        • Colours are interpreted by the viewing application.

_W_a_r_n_i_n_g:

     Support for all these devices are optional, so in packages they
     should be used conditionally after checking
     ‘capabilities("cairo")’.

_N_o_t_e:

     In principle these devices are independent of X11 (as is seen by
     their presence on Windows).  But on a Unix-alike the cairo
     libraries may be distributed as part of the X11 system and hence
     that (for example, on ‘x86_64’ macOS, XQuartz) may need to be
     installed.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘Devices’, ‘dev.print’, ‘pdf’, ‘postscript’

     ‘capabilities’ to see if cairo is supported.
